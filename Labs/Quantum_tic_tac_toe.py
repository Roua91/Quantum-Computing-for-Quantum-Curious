# Step 1: Define the Game Board
# The game board is represented by a quantum circuit with 9 qubits for the 3x3 grid.
# Each qubit corresponds to a square on the board.


# Step 2: Initialize the Board with Quantum Superposition
# Each square (qubit) is put into a superposition state using the Hadamard gate.


# Step 3: Player Moves
# Function to simulate a player's move by placing quantum markers on two squares.
def player_move(qc, qubit1, qubit2, player):
    print(f"{player} places quantum markers on squares {qubit1+1} and {qubit2+1}.")


    # Apply controlled-X (CX) gate to simulate quantum entanglement between the two squares

    
    # Apply Hadamard gates to maintain the qubits in superposition

    
    # Measure the qubits to simulate a partial collapse (for visualization purposes)
    qc.measure([qubit1, qubit2], [qubit1, qubit2])

# Function to get user input for moves with validation
def get_user_input(player):
    while True:
        try:
            # Prompt the user to enter two different squares (1-9)
            squares = input(f"{player}, enter two different squares (1-9) separated by a space: ").split()
            square1, square2 = int(squares[0]) - 1, int(squares[1]) - 1
            
            # Validate the input
            if square1 == square2 or not (0 <= square1 < 9 and 0 <= square2 < 9):
                raise ValueError("Invalid input. Please enter two different numbers between 1 and 9.")
            
            return square1, square2

            print("Invalid input. Please enter two different numbers between 1 and 9.")

# Step 4: Game Loop
# Loop through player moves
for i in range(4):
    # Player X's move
    
    
    # Player O's move


# Step 5: Collapse the Quantum State
# Measure all qubits to simulate the collapse of the quantum state.


# Step 6: Simulate the Quantum Circuit
# Use Qiskit's Aer simulator to simulate the quantum circuit and retrieve the result.
simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
compiled_circuit = transpile(qc, simulator)
qobj = assemble(compiled_circuit)
result = simulator.run(qobj).result()

# Step 7: Display the Results
# Get the counts of each possible final board state and print them.
counts = result.get_counts(qc)

    print(f"{state}: {count} times")
